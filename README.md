# Introduction

In this, I developed an online portal for the campaigners to send their current progress and view othersâ€™ progress for
the different activities of different marketing campaign.

The web portal lists the different advertising campaigns and other necessary details like location, date, description, etc. For every campaign, there can be any number of activities( along with their description, dates, current progress, etc.) and every activity can have any number of stages.

A client can communicate his current progress by selecting from the drop down in 'My response' where each activity with its start and end date. After admin testifies to it, it is reflected to the ambassadors(Clients are companies who want to advertise in colleges and amabassadors are people who volunteer for doing activities related to advertising) in their web portal.

The code goes inside the htdocs folder. 

Sample screenshot of the portal is shown below:
